Using Bash, run `./setup.sh`

This creates a super-basic react-ts-material starting point, without using create-react-app.

The settings here are completely up to my personal preference, but I have found them to work better
for me than the create-react-app defaults. Ejecting just to tweak several webpack parameters is
_painful._
